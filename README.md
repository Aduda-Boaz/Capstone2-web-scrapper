## Definition of The Project

This project is all about web scrapping, geting data or information from a website.

## About Project

The purpose of this project is to develop a scraper tool to achieve web-scrapping. This was achieved using Ruby, HTTparty and Nokogiri gem.

- Nokogiri is an HTML, XML, SAX, and Reader parser.

- The above Ruby Gems can be sources from [Ruby Gems](https://rubygems.org/)

In this project, I created a scraper which extracts available remote jobs at (https://www.indeed.com)
