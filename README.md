# Web Scraping using Nokogiri and Watir.

<h2 align="center">Ruby-Capstone-Project</h2>

## Definition of The Project

This project is all about web scrapping, geting data or information from a website.

## About Project

The purpose of this project is to develop a scraper tool to achieve web-scrapping. This was achieved using Ruby, Open-uri, Watir and Nokogiri gem.

- Watir (Web Application Testing In Ruby) helps in facilitating the writing of automated tests by  mimicing the behavior of a user interacting with a website.

- Nokogiri is an HTML, XML, SAX, and Reader parser.

- The above Ruby Gems can be sources from [Ruby Gems](https://rubygems.org/)

In this project, I created a scraper which extracts football results from BBC Sports website (https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/premier-league)
